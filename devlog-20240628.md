# Devlog #1 (2024-06-28)

## Introduction
Today I started getting my head around Github. It all seems so easy until I try to do something.

## Progress made

- Started working through [Python Arcade's Solitaire tutorial](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/tutorials/card_game/index.html).

## Challenges met

- Getting impatient because there are so many things I want to do but it takes so much of my limited time and energy to learn how to do them.
